# SnakeGame_Project
This is a snake game made out of complete HTML,CSS and JS
I used HTML to create the structure and layout of the game, ensuring a visually appealing and user friendly interface.
Added styling and animations to enhance the overall presentation of the game using CSS.
Used JavaScript's event-driven programming paradigm to handle user inputs and dynamically update the game state. This
involved managing the snake's movement.
